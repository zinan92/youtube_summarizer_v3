# Long-Term Memory & Learning Tools

This directory contains systematic tools for encoding and applying the meta-learning insights from our timeout problem breakthrough.

## What's in This Toolkit

### üìã `assumption_audit.md`
**Purpose**: Systematic checklists and templates for questioning hidden assumptions
**Use when**: Facing persistent technical problems that seem unsolvable
**Key features**:
- Five Whys (Enhanced) framework
- Assumption inventory templates  
- Remove-first debugging protocol
- Beginner's mind question bank

### üèóÔ∏è `architecture_review.md`  
**Purpose**: Templates for identifying architectural inconsistencies
**Use when**: Systems seem to solve similar problems in different ways
**Key features**:
- Pattern comparison matrices
- Inconsistency investigation templates
- Common anti-pattern detection
- Automated consistency checking ideas

## How to Apply These Tools

### For New Projects
1. Start with `assumption_audit.md` to document core assumptions
2. Use `architecture_review.md` to establish consistent patterns
3. Schedule regular reviews using these frameworks

### For Existing Problems
1. Run through the assumption audit checklist
2. Look for architectural inconsistencies  
3. Try the remove-first debugging approach
4. Document your findings for future reference

### For Code Reviews
- Add assumption-questioning to your review checklist
- Look for pattern inconsistencies between similar operations
- Challenge complexity before accepting it

## The Meta-Learning Principle

**Remember**: The most dangerous problems are the ones we don't know we have. These tools help surface invisible assumptions and architectural debt before they cause critical issues.

## Success Story Template

Document your wins using these tools:

```
## [Date] - [Problem Title]
**Original Problem**: 
**Tool Used**: 
**Key Insight**: 
**Solution**: 
**Time Saved**: 
**Lessons Learned**: 
```

## Integration with Claude Code Memory

These tools work with the `CLAUDE.md` file to ensure that:
1. **Individual insights** are captured in project memory
2. **Systematic processes** are available for future use  
3. **Meta-learning patterns** are preserved across projects
4. **Success stories** build institutional knowledge

The combination creates both **institutional memory** (through documentation) and **practical habits** (through systematic tools and processes).
